### **How Is the Contract Formed?**
We operate under a public offer agreement, which is published on our official website (see the "Terms & Conditions" link in the footer of the homepage). This means that by making an advance payment, you accept the terms of this agreement. The completion of the final payment signifies that you have approved the work and have signed the work completion certificate. Therefore, there will be no paper version of the contract; our agreement is concluded electronically.

   - We only work with residential spaces.

### **Limitations and Responsibility**
Roomy does not provide a technical project that grants permission for construction works, redevelopments, changes to building structures, electrical, or plumbing work; we only provide a visualization of how the space could theoretically look after renovation. Obtaining the necessary permits and the responsibility for carrying out the work and its consequences lies entirely with the client.

**If the project exceeds the standard scope, Roomy reserves the right to change the cost of services. This includes projects for spaces over 50 sq.m or those with complex configurations.**
