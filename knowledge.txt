### 1. General Overview of the Service

Roomy (www.roomy-design.com) is an online platform where users can order interior design projects for individual rooms without the need for in-person meetings with a designer. The service is exclusively for residential spaces, including kitchens, kitchen-living rooms, kitchen-dining rooms, living rooms, bedrooms, children's rooms, hallways, corridors, staircases, bathrooms, toilets, home offices, spa zones, terraces, balconies, and walk-in closets. The service is not intended for designing commercial interiors such as cafes, restaurants, offices, etc.

Clients can order the design of a single room or multiple rooms. They can place orders either sequentially, one after another, or simultaneously for several rooms. If more than one room is ordered, each room is treated as a separate project, independent from the others, with its own processing for order, execution, and payment.
