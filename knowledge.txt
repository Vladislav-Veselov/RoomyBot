### 1. General Overview of the Service

Roomy (www.roomy-design.com) is an online platform where users can order interior design projects for individual rooms without the need for in-person meetings with a designer. The service is exclusively for residential spaces, including kitchens, kitchen-living rooms, kitchen-dining rooms, living rooms, bedrooms, children's rooms, hallways, corridors, staircases, bathrooms, toilets, home offices, spa zones, terraces, balconies, and walk-in closets. The service is not intended for designing commercial interiors such as cafes, restaurants, offices, etc.

Clients can order the design of a single room or multiple rooms. They can place orders either sequentially, one after another, or simultaneously for several rooms. If more than one room is ordered, each room is treated as a separate project, independent from the others, with its own processing for order, execution, and payment.

Next is the **FAQ** block:

**WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THE INTERIOR MARKET?**
Back in the day, before 2018, we were your classic local design studio—face-to-face meetings, local projects, and lots of coffee. But in 2018, we went global (and digital)! Now, all you need is a smartphone, and voilà—design magic happens. Order from anywhere, anytime, even in your pajamas. Under our "Online Interior Solutions" concept, we've knocked out over 850 projects. So, yeah, we know our stuff.

**WHAT'S YOUR DESIGNERS' EXPERIENCE?**
No amateurs here! All our designers have architectural or design degrees and at least 3 years of industry experience. To join our team, they need to pass our tough accreditation. Plus, we double-check their work before showing it to you—because perfection takes practice!

**WHICH DESIGNER WILL WORK ON MY PROJECT?**
We know our designers’ styles like the back of our hand. After chatting with you, we’ll match you with the designer whose vibe aligns best with yours. Think of it as design matchmaking!

**WHAT IF I DON’T LIKE THE DESIGN?**
Design is a creative process, and sometimes we might not nail it on the first try—no worries! We’ll listen, tweak, and revise until you’re thrilled. If needed, we can even swap designers. Your satisfaction is our mission!

**WHERE DO WE WORK?**
As an online design studio, location is no issue. Whether you’re in Paris or the North Pole, we’ve got you covered. We work worldwide!

**HOW DO YOU FACTOR IN THE BUDGET I PLAN TO SPEND ON THE INTERIOR?**
We'll discuss the price range for materials and furnishings during our project chat. Our main goal is to create a unique interior on a budget, and we know how to make it happen!

**HOW DO I TAKE MEASUREMENTS FOR THE PROJECT?**
Just draw a rough sketch of the room by hand and measure the dimensions with a tape measure. Simple as that!

**WHAT IF I WANT TO KEEP SOME EXISTING ITEMS (LIKE FURNITURE OR ARTWORK) OR HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT SOME MATERIALS?**
No problem! Just send us photos of the items with their dimensions or details of the materials you've bought, and we'll work them into your new design.

**WHAT MATERIALS DO YOU INCLUDE IN THE PROJECT?**
We use materials that:
- Fit your agreed budget.
- Come from our trusted suppliers (price/quality/reliability).
- Can also include brands you specify.

**WHICH PROJECT SHOULD I CHOOSE: BASIC OR FULL?**
If you just want to refresh your space with new furniture, lighting, wall coverings, textiles, and decor, the basic project will be enough. For more extensive renovations, like structural changes or electrical work, the full project is better—it’s a complete renovation guide. Once we review your project details, we’ll help you decide which package is best for you.

**HOW LONG DOES THE PROJECT TAKE?**
It mostly depends on you—how quickly you provide feedback and how complex the project is. On average, designing a room takes between 5 to 15 days.

### 3. How to Order a Room Interior Design

The client clicks on the "Start Your Project" button. They are prompted to check off the type of room (multiple selection), allowing them to choose one or more rooms. They then fill in the forms with NAME (required field), EMAIL (required field), WHATSAPP (optional field), and click the Submit button. After submission, a notification appears: "Thank you, your request has been received, and an email has been sent to you to confirm the details of your order."

The client follows the link in the email. The link directs them to a section of our website where they find a questionnaire. In the questionnaire, they choose the type of room (only one type can be selected). Depending on the room type chosen by the client, a specific questionnaire opens, asking them to answer several questions about their preferences. The questionnaire also offers the option to attach photos of the room and a plan with dimensions. However, there is a note that these materials can be sent later via a reply email to the address from which they received the questionnaire link.

Once we have processed the data provided by the client, we send them a message (via email or email and Whatsapp, if they provided a phone number). In this message, we ask clarifying questions and request photos/videos of the room (if they did not provide them during the questionnaire). There may be several iterations of clarifying details and obtaining additional information. This communication takes place through email or Whatsapp. The goal of this communication is to understand all the client’s needs and preferences, answer their questions, ensure we have all the necessary materials to initiate the project, and determine which package the client will order (for each room if more than one is ordered).

We then send the client an invoice for a 50% advance payment and begin work.

### Packages Available for Clients and When to Choose Them:

**Basic set for light space makeover.**
This package is suitable if the client wants to refresh the interior: change wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, replace furniture and textiles. This project allows for minor layout changes (slightly moving furniture, adjusting

 the dimensions of new furniture). The Room layout plan is created to ensure that the current layout is optimal or to offer improvements if we see potential. If the client is open to layout changes, we do not limit the number of layout adjustments and will make revisions until the client is completely satisfied.

This package includes:
- **Room layout plan**: A top-down scaled plan with dimensions showing the room’s layout, including windows, doors, and furniture placement with dimensions and walkway sizes.
- **2 interior design style concepts**: These are boards presented as collages that show:
  - The interior color scheme.
  - Selection of wall and floor coverings.
  - Chosen furniture pieces.
  - Lighting fixtures.
  - Textiles.
  - Decorative elements.

We create two different concepts for the client to choose from. If the client does not approve either concept, we will provide additional options based on their feedback.

If the client finds the design concepts insufficient, they can order a 3D visualization and VR tour as an additional package after approving the concept board.

- **The interior shopping list**: A detailed list of all materials and items included in the project, containing:
  - An image of the item.
  - Its name.
  - A brief description.
  - Quantity.
  - Price.
  - A link to the store where it can be purchased.
The shopping list helps the client evaluate their budget.

The shopping list is only created after the client approves the design concept in the form of a board (or 3D visualization if they added this to their order).

**For more extensive renovations:**
If the client needs to make more significant renovations, such as major layout changes, moving electrical outlets, modifying the lighting scheme, or constructing new elements, we recommend they order **Renovation drawings**. These can be ordered with or without visualization and a VR tour.

Renovation drawings include:

- **A wall elevation drawing**: A detailed view of your walls, showing their height and all finishing materials and details. It helps visualize how the walls will look with furniture, decor, and other elements, simplifying design planning and implementation. This drawing is also a useful tool for builders to execute the project accurately.
- **A ceiling plan**: A detailed drawing that shows the layout and design of a ceiling, including the placement of ventilation grills, other structural elements, and ceiling finishes. It provides a clear view of how the ceiling will look and function within the overall design of the space.
- **A flooring plan**: A comprehensive drawing that outlines the design and layout of a floor, detailing the placement of structural elements and the types of flooring materials used. It provides a clear understanding of how the floor will appear and function within the overall space.
- **A lighting plan**: A detailed drawing that shows the layout and placement of lighting fixtures throughout a space. It includes information on the types of fixtures, their positions, and how they will interact with the overall design, ensuring the space is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
- **A lighting control plan**: A detailed drawing that outlines how lighting systems will be managed within a space. It includes the placement of switches, dimmers, sensors, and control panels, as well as how different zones of lighting will interact. This plan ensures that the lighting can be easily adjusted for different moods and functions, providing both convenience and energy efficiency.
- **An outlet placement plan**: A detailed drawing that shows the location and arrangement of electrical outlets throughout a space. It includes information on the type and placement of outlets, ensuring they are conveniently positioned for all your electrical needs and seamlessly integrated into the overall design.
- **An electrical fixture specification**: A document that describes the types and quantities of electrical components in a space, including switches, outlets, faceplates, and other electrical elements.

### Package Pricing:
- **Basic**: 199 Euros
- **3D Visualization**: 199 Euros
- **Renovation Drawings**: 249 Euros

This pricing does not depend on the type and size of the room. In some cases, if the room exceeds reasonable size and complexity, we may increase the project cost, which will be communicated to the client in advance.

After receiving the 50% advance payment from the client (total depending on their order), we begin the work. During the process, we communicate with the client in their preferred way, ask questions, show results, receive feedback, and make revisions until they are satisfied. We then compile the project into a PDF album and send it to the client along with a link for the remaining 50%. After receiving the balance, we send the client the shopping list separately (within 3 days). We remain available for project support, meaning the client can ask questions about the project if something needs clarification during the renovation. If any errors are found in the project, we will make corrections at no additional cost.

According to company policy, we do not communicate with clients by phone. All communication is through email or Whatsapp.

Drawings cannot be ordered without concept boards, as they form the foundation for the complete project. Without them, we can only create the shopping list and drawings.

If the client requests an interior design for a combined space with different functional zones (e.g., a bathroom combined with a toilet, a kitchen combined with a living room, a kitchen combined with a dining room, etc.), we consider this as one room, meaning the service cost is calculated as for a single room, not for each zone separately. If there are more than two functional zones, we need to review the project details before making a final offer. To do this, we ask the client to send us photos or videos of the space to info@roomy-design.com, and we will send them a project cost estimate in response.

If the client's request goes beyond the services described in this file (e.g., they want to order only specific elements from our service packages, or they want a project for an entire apartment or house), we will likely fulfill the order, but such requests fall outside our standard offering, so we will need to create a custom proposal based on their specific needs. In such cases, we ask the client to provide a detailed description of their request and leave their email address, to which we will respond shortly.
